    <title>Classes</title>
    <shortdesc>The part of the data model describing the aspects of the health and care business
        with significant characteristics.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Within this publication, the names of Classes are styled like this: <ph
                outputclass="class">ACTIVITY</ph>.</p>
        <p>A Class is something that you want to describe; the attributes define the descriptive
            characteristics of the class. </p>
        <p>Classes within a data model may be refined into more specific classes.  For example, both
                <ph outputclass="class">CLINICAL INVESTIGATION</ph> and <ph outputclass="class">CARE
                CONTACT</ph> are types of a <ph outputclass="class">CARE ACTIVITY</ph>, which in
            turn is a type of <ph outputclass="class">ACTIVITY</ph>.</p>
        <p>Where there are no significant differences in the characteristics of a kind of Class, NHS
            Business Definitions are used to relate a particular business context to a use of a
            Class. For example, a <ph outputclass="businessDefinition">Laparoscopy</ph> is a type of
                <ph outputclass="class">CLINICAL INVESTIGATION</ph>.</p>
