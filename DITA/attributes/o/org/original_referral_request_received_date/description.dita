    <searchtitle>Attribute: ORIGINAL REFERRAL REQUEST RECEIVED DATE - Description</searchtitle>
  </titlealts>
  <body>

  <p>
This records the first 
    <xref outputclass="attribute"
            keyref="attribute_referral_request_received_date">REFERRAL REQUEST RECEIVED DATE</xref>
 for a specific health care service to be provided, which was received. This date should be recorded on any subsequent 
    <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_referral_request">REFERRAL REQUESTS</xref>
 for the same health care service and should never be altered or removed, even if the 
    <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
            keyref="business_definition_health_care_provider">Health Care Provider</xref>
 changes, until the specific health care service is provided for the 
    <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
, or is no longer required or the 
    <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 initiates a reset of the waiting period.  </p>
  <p>
In cases where a 
    <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 is transferred to another 
    <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
            keyref="business_definition_health_care_provider">Health Care Provider</xref>
 as initiated by the transferring provider; and the receiving provider and the 
    <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 both agree to the transfer, the 
    <xref outputclass="attribute"
            keyref="attribute_original_referral_request_received_date">ORIGINAL REFERRAL REQUEST RECEIVED DATE</xref>
 should also be transferred and retained as the 
    <xref outputclass="attribute"
            keyref="attribute_original_referral_request_received_date">ORIGINAL REFERRAL REQUEST RECEIVED DATE</xref>
 of the receiving provider. This is due to the receiving provider becoming responsible for 
    <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 waiting time including the period of wait before the transfer.  </p>
  <p>
In cases where a 
    <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 initiates transfer themselves to another 
    <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
            keyref="business_definition_health_care_provider">Health Care Provider</xref>
 and remove themselves from the waiting list of their current provider then the waiting period will reset. The 
    <xref outputclass="attribute"
            keyref="attribute_referral_request_received_date">REFERRAL REQUEST RECEIVED DATE</xref>
 of the new provider will be used to record the 
    <xref outputclass="attribute"
            keyref="attribute_original_referral_request_received_date">ORIGINAL REFERRAL REQUEST RECEIVED DATE</xref>
. This will exclude any period of wait before the transfer took place.  </p>
