 for an individual 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 which have been planned and prescribed as a whole. It should be noted that the following all constitute one course of treatment:        </p>

 located on two or more

If a 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 has two unrelated diseases both of which require 
              <xref outputclass="businessDefinition" keyref="business_definition_radiotherapy">Radiotherapy</xref>, each course of treatment should be recorded as a primary course.        </p>
    <p>
Similarly if a 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 has two primary lesions of the same disease, eg two rodent ulcers, the treatment of these comprises two primary courses, unless the lesions are in such close proximity that they are to be treated together.        </p>
    <p>
If during a course of treatment, a 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 starts a further course, the second course should be separately identified.        </p>
