A flag indicating that 
              <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
               keyref="business_definition_specialised_service">Specialised Service</xref>
 top-up payments are to be paid to reimburse 
              <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
               keyref="business_definition_health_care_provider">Health Care Providers</xref>
 for the higher costs of treating 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENTS</xref>
 who require this specialised care.         </p>
      <p>
National prices in the 
              <xref outputclass="supportingInformation"
               keyref="supporting_definition_national_tariff_payment_system">National Tariff Payment System</xref>
 are calculated on the basis of average costs. They do not therefore take into account cost differences between 
              <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
               keyref="business_definition_health_care_provider">Health Care Providers</xref>
 that arise because some 
              <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
               keyref="business_definition_health_care_provider">Health Care Providers</xref>
 serve 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENTS</xref>
 with more complex needs.        </p>
      <p>
The purpose of 
              <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
               keyref="business_definition_specialised_service">Specialised Service</xref>
 top-up payments for inpatient care relating to some 
              <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
               keyref="business_definition_specialised_service">Specialised Services</xref>
 is to recognise these cost differences and to improve the extent to which prices paid reflect the actual costs of providing healthcare, when this is not sufficiently differentiated in the 
              <xref outputclass="supportingInformation"
               keyref="supporting_definition_healthcare_resource_group">Healthcare Resource Group</xref>
 design.        </p>
