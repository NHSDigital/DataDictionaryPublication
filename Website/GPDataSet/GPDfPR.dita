                        <entry>The collection of GP Data for Planning and Research will start from 1
                            September 2021. NHS Digital has been directed by the Secretary of State
                            for Health and Social Care under the General Practice Data for Planning
                            and Research Directions 2021 to collect and analyse data from GP
                            practices for health and social care purposes including policy,
                            planning, commissioning, public health and research purposes. The data
                            held in the GP medical records of patients is used every day to support
                            health and care planning and research in England, helping to find better
                            treatments and improve patient outcomes for everyone. NHS Digital has
                            developed a new way to collect this data, called the General Practice
                            Data for Planning and Research data collection. The new data collection
                            reduces burden on GP practices, allowing doctors and other staff to
                            focus on patient care. For further information see: General Practice
                            Data for Planning and Research (GPDfPR). Only structured and coded data
                            from patient medical records that is needed for specific health and
                            social care purposes will be collected; data that directly identifies an
                            individual patient, including NHS number, General Practice Local Patient
                            Number, full postcode, date of birth and if relevant date of death, is
                            replaced with unique codes produced by de-identification software before
                            it is sent to NHS Digital. Further information about what data are
                            collected can be found in the table links below. The data are stored in
                            a relational data model with separate tables for different aspects of
                            primary care. The information is correct as Version 1 of the GP Data Set
                            on 12 May 2021 and is not expected to be updated. If you have a question
                            about the General Praxtice Data for Planning and Research data

                        <entry>Coding systems The GPDfPR uses coded data within patient records,
                            however there are several coding systems available for use in primary
                            care. The data model allows for data from several coding systems to be
                            collected. A coded concept may mean something different in each table of
                            the relational model e.g. a code in the allergy table could represent a
                            specific allergy or allergic reaction whereas a code in the immunisation
                            table could represent a specific vaccination; therefore a separate
                            'Codeable concept' table is provided within this data dictionary to
                            provide the generic data dictionary for each coding system. By
                            convention it is expected that codes will be extracted in the
                            terminology that was originally used to record the coded information
                            e.g. legacy Read v2 or CTV3 codes along with a Snomed translation. When
                            information is recorded directly in Snomed CT only the Snomed code will
                            be extracted. By convention, both the Snomed Concept Id and Description
                            Id are extracted where possible. For further information see:</entry>

                            there is a degree of information lossage i.e. fewer identifiers and

                            resources into a single record for simplicity. The cases where this

                            of the same practitioner in different organisations should be
