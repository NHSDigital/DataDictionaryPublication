    <shortdesc>The part of the data model describing the aspects of the health and care business
        with significant characteristics.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Within this publication, the names of Classes are styled like this: <xref
            href="https://datadictionary.nhs.uk/classes/activity.html" scope="external" format="html"
                outputclass="class">ACTIVITY</xref>.</p>
        <p>A Class is something that you want to describe; the Attributes define the descriptive
            characteristics of the Class. </p>
        <p>Classes within a data model may be refined into more specific classes. For example, both
                <xref href="https://datadictionary.nhs.uk/classes/clinical_intervention.html"
                    scope="external" format="html" outputclass="class">CLINICAL INTERVENTION</xref> and <xref
                        href="https://datadictionary.nhs.uk/classes/care_contact.html" scope="external" format="html"
                outputclass="class">CARE CONTACT</xref> are types of a <xref
                    href="https://datadictionary.nhs.uk/classes/care_activity.html" scope="external" format="html"
                outputclass="class">CARE ACTIVITY</xref>, which in turn is a type of <xref
                    href="https://datadictionary.nhs.uk/classes/activity.html" scope="external" format="html"
                outputclass="class">ACTIVITY</xref>.</p>
        <p>Where there are no significant differences in the characteristics of a kind of Class, NHS
            Business Definitions are used to relate a particular business context to a use of a
            Class. For example, a <xref
                href="https://datadictionary.nhs.uk/nhs_business_definitions/laparoscopy.html"
                scope="external" format="html" outputclass="businessDefinition">Laparoscopy</xref> is a type of
                <xref href="https://datadictionary.nhs.uk/classes/clinical_intervention.html"
                    scope="external" format="html" outputclass="class">CLINICAL INTERVENTION</xref>.</p>
