  </titlealts>
  <body>
  <div>
      <p>
A subtype of 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_waiting_list">WAITING LIST</xref>.        </p>
      <p>
A list of 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENTS</xref>, for whom a 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_decision_to_admit">DECISION TO ADMIT</xref>
 has been made, currently awaiting admission regardless of whether a date to admit has been given.        </p>
      <p>
A 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 can be on more than one 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_elective_admission_list">ELECTIVE ADMISSION LIST</xref>. This may be because the 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 needs treatment for more than one condition or because the 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 has been placed on the list of more than one provider for the same condition.        </p>
      <p>
It is also possible for a 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 to be entered on an 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_elective_admission_list">ELECTIVE ADMISSION LIST</xref>
 more than once, either for a different condition or for the same condition, where two or more admissions are required. For example, a 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 would have two 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_elective_admission_list_entry">ELECTIVE ADMISSION LIST ENTRIES</xref>
 on a list where the intention was to perform two or more operations requiring two or more admissions, such as repair of inguinal hernia and operation on varicose veins. Only one 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_elective_admission_list_entry">ELECTIVE ADMISSION LIST ENTRY</xref>
 should be made in the event of the intention to perform two or more procedures during one admission.        </p>
      <p>
         <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENTS</xref>
 already in a 
              <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
               keyref="business_definition_hospital_bed">Hospital Bed</xref>
 who are waiting for transfer in the same 
              <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
               keyref="business_definition_health_care_provider">Health Care Provider</xref>
 unit or to another 
              <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
               keyref="business_definition_health_care_provider">Health Care Provider</xref>
 unit should not be included in an 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_elective_admission_list">ELECTIVE ADMISSION LIST</xref>
 for the condition being treated or for the treatment for which they are awaiting transfer. An 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_elective_admission_list">ELECTIVE ADMISSION LIST</xref>
 is only for 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENTS</xref>
 without a current 
              <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
               keyref="business_definition_hospital_provider_spell">Hospital Provider Spell</xref>, waiting for admission to hospital to start a 
              <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
               keyref="business_definition_hospital_provider_spell">Hospital Provider Spell</xref>
 and 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENTS</xref>
 already admitted and waiting for a 
              <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
               keyref="business_definition_hospital_bed">Hospital Bed</xref>
 elsewhere should not be included.        </p>
