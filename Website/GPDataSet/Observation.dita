    <shortdesc>Represents record entries in the source system mapped to Observation resources and is
        the default record type for all source record content which is not mapped to a more specific
        resource type. Despite the name, the catch all nature of the Observation resources means
        that this resource type will carry a range of coded content and will not be restricted to
        'observables'.</shortdesc>
