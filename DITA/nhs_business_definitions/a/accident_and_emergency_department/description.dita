 is a

 may be either major units, providing a 24 hour service seven days a week to which the great majority of emergency ambulance cases are taken, or small units commonly called casualty departments, in which services are often only available for limited hours and which may not deal with emergency ambulance cases.  </p>
  <p>
A casualty department is not always part of a 
    <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
            keyref="business_definition_hospital_site">Hospital Site</xref>
. Additional activities may also take place such as: elective surgical work of a minor nature, observation and treatment of

 in 
    <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"

An accident and emergency service offers care to 
    <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENTS</xref>
 who arrive with urgent problems and who have not usually been seen previously by a 
    <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_general_practitioner">GENERAL PRACTITIONER</xref>
.  </p>
  <p>
In the case of serious illness or accident, the treatment provided will be vital resuscitation only before the 
    <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 is admitted to hospital.  </p>
