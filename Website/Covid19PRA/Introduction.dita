            <p id="p_tk3_l3t_w4b"> NHS Digital has used QCovid® to develop the <xref

                format="html" scope="external">COVID-19 Population Risk Assessment</xref>. (PRA). This combines a number of factors such as age, sex registered
                at birth, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI) and specific health conditions and
                treatments to estimate the risk of a person catching coronavirus and becoming
                seriously unwell.</p>
            <p>Centrally held patient data was used to identify people who might be at high risk,
                using the codes listed here. Using data in this way for the COVID-19 Population Risk
                Assessment is providing ongoing opportunities for improvements in care through
                identification of particular cohorts of patients in primary care.</p>
            <p>The University of Oxford’s QCovid® model was developed using the QResearch database,
                which includes anonymised GP record data and uses SNOMED-CT codes and Read v2 codes.
                To allow the model to be applied at a population level, an expanded list of
                SNOMED-CT codes was produced. This expanded list of codes was used to implement the
                COVID-19 Population Risk Assessment but was not used in the research to develop the
                model. <xref

                    sets</xref>.</p>
            <p>This is in line with the precautionary approach to be as inclusive as possible and
                overestimate rather than underestimate risk and helps to ensure that people who may
                be at high risk from coronavirus receive advice, priority access to vaccination and
                other support available to people added to the <xref
