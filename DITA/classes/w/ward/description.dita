  <p>
A group of 
    <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
            keyref="business_definition_hospital_bed">Hospital Beds</xref>
 with associated treatment facilities managed as a single unit for the purposes of staffing and treatment responsibilities. All the rooms in a small hospital may be managed by one senior 
    <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_nurse">NURSE</xref>
 and as a single unit and thus they would comprise one 
    <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_ward">WARD</xref>
. A 
    <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_ward">WARD</xref>
 may be available all the time or for only limited time periods during the day or week.  </p>
  <p>
A critical care unit will comprise one 
    <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_ward">WARD</xref>
 if theÂ 
    <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
            keyref="business_definition_hospital_bed">Hospital Beds</xref>
 and associated treatment facilities are managed as a single unit.  </p>
  <p>
Maternity wards of the same 'type' on the same site should for national purposes be treated as one 
    <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_ward">WARD</xref>
, so that a 
    <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 moving between them is not counted as a transfer between 
    <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_ward">WARDS</xref>
. For local purposes it may be useful to identify separately such transfers. Facilities specifically used for delivery in maternity wards should be included as 
    <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_ward">WARDS</xref>
, or annexed to 
    <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_ward">WARDS</xref>
.  </p>
