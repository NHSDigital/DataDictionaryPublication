    <searchtitle>Attribute: APPOINTMENT FIRST ATTENDANCE - Description</searchtitle>
  </titlealts>
  <body>
  <div>
      <p>
This indicates, when an attendance or contact is to take place as an 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_appointment">APPOINTMENT</xref>, whether it is a first attendance 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_appointment">APPOINTMENT</xref>
 or a follow-up attendance 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_appointment">APPOINTMENT</xref>.        </p>
      <p>
If the 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 does not attend the first 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_appointment">APPOINTMENT</xref>, another first attendance 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_appointment">APPOINTMENT</xref>
 should be made.        </p>
      <p>
An 
              <xref outputclass="attribute" keyref="attribute_appointment_first_attendance">APPOINTMENT FIRST ATTENDANCE</xref>
 may be the first in a series such as an 
              <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
               keyref="business_definition_consultant_out-patient_episode">Consultant Out-Patient Episode</xref>, or only 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_appointment">APPOINTMENT</xref>
 which took place regardless of how many previous 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_appointment">APPOINTMENTS</xref>
 were made which did not take place for whatever reason. All subsequent 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_appointment">APPOINTMENTS</xref>
 in the series which take place should be recorded as follow-up.        </p>
      <p>
Where one or more 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_appointment">APPOINTMENT</xref>
 is recorded for a 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 but none has as yet taken place, the notional 
              <i>'Appointment first attendance'</i>
 will be the 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_appointment">APPOINTMENT</xref>
 with the earliest 
              <xref outputclass="attribute" keyref="attribute_appointment_date">APPOINTMENT DATE</xref>. This excludes any 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_appointment">APPOINTMENTS</xref>
 which have been cancelled as indicated by a recorded 
              <xref outputclass="attribute" keyref="attribute_appointment_cancelled_date">APPOINTMENT CANCELLED DATE</xref>.        </p>
