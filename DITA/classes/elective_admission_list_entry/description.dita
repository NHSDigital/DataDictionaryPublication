      <p>
An entry on an 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_elective_admission_list">ELECTIVE ADMISSION LIST</xref>
 denoting a 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 for whom the 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_decision_to_admit">DECISION TO ADMIT</xref>
 has been made.        </p>
      <p>
Being placed on the 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_elective_admission_list">ELECTIVE ADMISSION LIST</xref>
 will result in an 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_elective_admission_list_entry">ELECTIVE ADMISSION LIST ENTRY</xref>. When the 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_elective_admission_list_entry">ELECTIVE ADMISSION LIST ENTRY</xref>
 is first recorded, the 
              <xref outputclass="attribute"
               keyref="attribute_original_decided_to_admit_date">ORIGINAL DECIDED TO ADMIT DATE</xref>
 should be recorded as the same as the 
              <xref outputclass="attribute" keyref="attribute_decided_to_admit_date">DECIDED TO ADMIT DATE</xref>
 of the first 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_decision_to_admit">DECISION TO ADMIT</xref>.        </p>
      <p>
It is possible for a 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 to have more than one 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_elective_admission_list_entry">ELECTIVE ADMISSION LIST ENTRY</xref>, either for a different condition or for the same condition where two or more admissions are required.        </p>
      <p>
Only one 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_elective_admission_list_entry">ELECTIVE ADMISSION LIST ENTRY</xref>
 should be made in the event of the intention to perform two or more procedures during one admission.        </p>
      <p>
To monitor key targets it is necessary for the 
              <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
               keyref="business_definition_health_care_provider">Health Care Provider</xref>
 responsible for the 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_elective_admission_list">ELECTIVE ADMISSION LIST</xref>, to record the date of any previous 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_offer_of_admission">OFFERS OF ADMISSION</xref>
 for the same condition, which was made by a previous 
              <xref outputclass="businessDefinition"
               keyref="business_definition_health_care_provider">Health Care Provider</xref>
 and then cancelled byÂ them on the day of or after admission for non-medical reasons.        </p>
      <p>
The 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_elective_admission_list_entry">ELECTIVE ADMISSION LIST ENTRY</xref>
 is removed from the 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_waiting_list">WAITING LIST</xref>
 when the PATIENT is admitted or removed for other specified reasons. ELECTIVE ADMISSION LIST REMOVAL REASON records the method of removal from the list and 
              <xref outputclass="attribute"
               keyref="attribute_elective_admission_list_removal_date">ELECTIVE ADMISSION LIST REMOVAL DATE</xref>
 records the removal date.        </p>
      <p>
Once removed from the 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_elective_admission_list">ELECTIVE ADMISSION LIST</xref>, the 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 ceases to be waiting for admission and all associated 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_offer_of_admission">OFFERS OF ADMISSION</xref>
 become inactive.        </p>
      <p>
Note: An 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_elective_admission_list_entry">ELECTIVE ADMISSION LIST ENTRY</xref>
 must be related to a 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_decision_to_admit">DECISION TO ADMIT</xref>.        </p>
