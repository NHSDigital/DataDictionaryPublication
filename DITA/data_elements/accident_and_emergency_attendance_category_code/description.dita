A 
              <xref outputclass="attribute" keyref="attribute_first_attendance">FIRST ATTENDANCE</xref>
 is the first or only attendance for the same incident, which may be an injury or occurrence of a condition; a follow-up attendance is a visit to the same department for the same incident as the first visit within the episode. If a 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 has a recurring condition, such as epilepsy, or a tendency for joints to dislocate, there would be a new 
              <xref outputclass="attribute" keyref="attribute_first_attendance">FIRST ATTENDANCE</xref>
 each time that the 
              <xref outputclass="class" keyref="class_patient">PATIENT</xref>
 presents with the condition.        </p>
      <p>A subsequent attendance may not always be a follow-up attendance. It could qualify as an attendance at a consultant out-patient clinic and if so, it needs to be recorded appropriately.</p>
