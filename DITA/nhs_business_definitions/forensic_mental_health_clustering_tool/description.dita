         <xref outputclass="element" keyref="element_assessment_tool_completion_date">ASSESSMENT TOOL COMPLETION DATE</xref>, the evidence and clinical judgement would suggest that there is still a cause for concern that cannot be disregarded. In these circumstances, any event that remains relevant to the current
