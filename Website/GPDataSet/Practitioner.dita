    <title>Practitioner</title>
    <shortdesc>Represents attributed practitioners, staff and other persons referenced by entries in
        the patient record. Typically these will be clinicians associated with a practice but may
        also include external practitioners such as consultants and other Health Care Professionals
        (HCPs.) 'Foreign' practitioners propagated into the practice via GP2GP or other messaging
        transactions who are attributed to entries in the patient record may also be included.
        Typically in these cases there is a degree of information lossage i.e. fewer identifiers and
        greater reliance on names; Combines Practitioner and Practitioner Role resources into a
        single record for simplicity. The cases where this means redundant records are required to
        account for multiple instances of the same practitioner in different organisations should be
        rare.</shortdesc>
