    <shortdesc>The NHS Data Model and Dictionary is published using Mauro Data Mapper</shortdesc>
    <body>
        <p>The Mauro Data Mapper (also known as the Oxford Metadata Catalogue) is used to develop
            and maintain linked, versioned descriptions of data standards, datasets, and
            questionnaires. These descriptions capture essential structure and context together with
            a detailed account of each variable, comprising: name, natural language definition, data
            type, and multiplicity.</p>
        <p>NHS Digital has been working closely with the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre to
            migrate the NHS Data Model and Dictionary onto Mauro Data Mapper, improving the quality
            of the data modelling in the process.  </p>
        <p>The Oxford Biomedical Research Centre is based at the Oxford University Hospitals NHS
            Foundation Trust and run in partnership with the University of Oxford. It is funded by
            the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). </p>
